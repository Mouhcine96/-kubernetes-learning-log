# Day 01 – Kubernetes Basics

## What I learned today
- Difference between monolithic applications and microservices
- Why monoliths are hard to scale and operate in the cloud
- Core benefits of microservices: decoupling, modularity, independent scaling
- Why containers are a key enabler for microservices

## Tools / Platforms
- Linux Foundation: Introduction to Kubernetes (LFS158)

## Reflections
- I recognized many of these challenges from my own experience running Nextcloud AIO
- This helped me better understand why Kubernetes and containers solve real operational problems
