# Day 02 – Container Orchestration

## Core idea
Container orchestration manages containers across multiple hosts to provide scalability,
fault tolerance, and automation.

## Why this matters
Running containers on a single host does not scale and creates single points of failure.
Orchestrators like Kubernetes automate restarts, placement, and scaling.

## Key takeaway
Containers package applications.
Orchestrators operate systems.

## Containers – recap

- Containers are isolated processes sharing the host OS kernel.
- They package applications together with their dependencies.
- Container images are immutable templates.
- Containers are running instances of images.
