# Day 04 – Kubernetes Foundations & CNCF Ecosystem

## Core Idea
Kubernetes is an open-source system for orchestrating containerized applications.  
It was originally developed by Google, inspired by its internal cluster manager Borg.  
Today, Kubernetes is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## What I Learned Today
- Definition of Kubernetes
- Reasons for using Kubernetes
- Core features and capabilities of Kubernetes
- How Kubernetes evolved from Google's Borg
- The role of the CNCF and its cloud-native project ecosystem

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is a platform that:
- Automates deployment of containerized workloads
- Ensures scalability and fault tolerance
- Manages resources efficiently
- Provides service discovery and networking abstractions
- Unifies operations across different infrastructure environments

In short:  
Kubernetes turns many individual machines into a single, reliable system for running containerized applications.

## Why Use Kubernetes?
Kubernetes addresses the key needs of modern production environments:
- Automatic scheduling
- Self-healing workloads (restarts, rescheduling, recovery)
- Horizontal scaling
- Service discovery and built-in load balancing
- Zero-downtime deployments and declarative configuration
- Portability across infrastructure and cloud providers

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration.

## Evolution: From Borg to Kubernetes
Borg was Google’s internal system for managing large-scale distributed workloads.  
Concepts inherited from Borg include:
- Viewing clusters as one large logical system
- Automatic workload placement (scheduling)
- Self-healing applications
- Container-based process isolation
- Declarative “desired state” operation

Kubernetes is essentially the open-source successor to the ideas that shaped Borg.

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
The CNCF hosts Kubernetes and coordinates a broad ecosystem of cloud-native projects.

Examples of key CNCF projects:
- Argo
- Cilium
- Prometheus
- Fluentd
- etcd
- CoreDNS
- containerd
- CRI-O
- Helm
- Envoy
- Istio
- Linkerd

The CNCF provides governance, community support, vendor neutrality, and long-term project stewardship.

## Learning Objectives – Completed
- Define Kubernetes
- Explain why Kubernetes is used
- Describe key Kubernetes features
- Understand the evolution from Borg to Kubernetes
- Explain the role of the CNCF

## Key Takeaway
Kubernetes combines Google’s large-scale operational experience with CNCF’s vendor-neutral open-source governance.  
This makes Kubernetes the central standard for modern distributed, containerized applications.
