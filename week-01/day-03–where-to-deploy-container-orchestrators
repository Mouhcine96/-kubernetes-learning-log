# Day 03 – Where to Deploy Container Orchestrators

## Core idea
Container orchestrators are infrastructure-agnostic.
They can be deployed on almost any compute platform: local, on-premises, or in the cloud.

## Deployment options

Container orchestrators like Kubernetes can run on:

- Bare metal servers
- Virtual machines
- Local workstations
- On-premises data centers
- Public clouds
- Hybrid environments

Kubernetes does not require a specific vendor or platform.
It abstracts the underlying infrastructure.

## Local and on-prem deployments

Kubernetes can be deployed:

- Directly on a workstation
- Inside virtual machines
- Using local hypervisors or container runtimes

These setups are commonly used for:
- Learning
- Development
- Testing
- Proof of concepts

## Cloud deployments

In production, Kubernetes is often deployed on cloud infrastructure such as:
- Virtual machines provided by cloud vendors
- IaaS platforms (e.g. EC2, GCE, OpenStack)

This offers scalability but still requires significant operational effort.

## Managed Kubernetes (KaaS)

Operating Kubernetes clusters is complex.
To reduce this complexity, cloud providers offer **Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS)**.

With KaaS:
- The control plane is managed by the provider
- Cluster installation requires only a few commands
- Operational burden is reduced

Examples include:
- Amazon EKS
- Azure AKS
- Google GKE
- DigitalOcean Kubernetes
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
- VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid

## Key takeaway
Kubernetes can run almost anywhere.
Managed Kubernetes shifts operational responsibility to cloud providers and is the dominant choice for production environments.
